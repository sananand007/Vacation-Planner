# Vacation planner
## Idea
* Create an app for travelers to find optimal route under budget constraint. 
* The user enters the budget, start and end date of the traveling and locations of interest.
* The initial version only considers route planning related to POI instead of considering dining preferences, etc. 
* Once confirmed the route, the app should be able to track the progress of the traveler and adjust route intelligently. 
## Public APIs
* For hotel / flight / car rental queries, use Expedia public API or similar services.
* For finding route on land, use Google Maps Directions API.
## Programming Languages
* Backend: Golang
* Frontend: Javascript
